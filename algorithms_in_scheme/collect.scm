;; This might help. It is an extend-syntax version of collect which has not been
;; tested other than to show that it expands into what looks to be the right
;; thing. The function nth is just like Common Lisp, if you want to use
;; list-ref, just switch the order of the two arguments. I use `with' clauses
;; to help build the let bindings. This is the only complicated feature used.
